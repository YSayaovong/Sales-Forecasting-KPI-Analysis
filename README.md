## 📚 Case Study: Sales Decline Investigation & Forecast Recovery

### ✅ Scenario
A mid-sized retail company experiences a noticeable drop in quarterly sales.  
Executives report:
- Sales are **down 14%** compared to the same period last year.
- Two major product lines are underperforming.
- Regional managers believe the issue is marketing spend; finance believes it's pricing; operations blames inventory availability.

The company needs clarity, and fast.

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Review & KPI Breakdown
After ingesting the last 36 months of sales history:

**Findings:**
- The decline is concentrated in **Product Line B**, not across the whole business.
- Region West accounts for **61%** of the downturn.
- Forecast Accuracy dropped from **92% → 78%**, indicating a shift in behavior.
- Quarter-over-quarter growth for Product Line B is **–22%**, while others remain stable.

The dashboard highlights the drop instantly with:
- Red variance indicators  
- Forecast vs. Actual deviation charts  
- Contribution-to-revenue visuals  

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Forecast Modeling
Time-series models (ARIMA / Prophet / Exponential Smoothing) are run on each product line.

**Model Output:**
- Product Line B expected to continue declining another **8–12% over the next quarter**.
- Product Line A shows stable seasonality and 5% projected growth.
- Price elasticity modeling shows a **high sensitivity**: a recent 7% price increase likely caused a portion of the decline.

### ✅ Step 3 — Root Cause Insights
By filtering the dashboard and drilling down:

**Root causes identified:**
1. **Marketing spend dropped 40%** in the West region due to budget delays.
2. Competitor launched a similar product at **6% lower price**.
3. Inventory coverage dipped below **2 weeks of supply** during a seasonal demand spike.

None of these were clear before because data lived in separate systems.

### ✅ Step 4 — Executive Recommendations
Using the forecast and KPI findings, the model recommends:

- Roll back the price increase or add promotional discounts (expected +6% rebound).  
- Restore regional marketing budget to baseline (expected +4–7% revenue lift).  
- Increase inventory buffer for high-demand weeks (+3% revenue protection).  

Executives receive this summary directly through the Power BI executive dashboard.

### ✅ Step 5 — Outcome
After implementing changes:

- Sales decline reversed within 2 reporting cycles.
