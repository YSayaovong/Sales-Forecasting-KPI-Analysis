*(SQL + Python + Power BI — Real-World Retail Analytics)*

A mid-sized retail company experiences a sudden **14% quarterly sales decline**.

## ✅ Step 1 — Data Review & KPI Breakdown

After ingesting **36 months** of transaction-level sales history:

### 🔎 Key Findings
- The downturn is **NOT company-wide**.  
- The drop is isolated to **Product Line B**, responsible for **61%** of the decline.  
- Forecast accuracy has slipped from **92% → 78%**, signaling unstable customer behavior.  
- Quarter-over-quarter decline for Product Line B hits **–22%**, while other lines stay flat or grow.

Power BI reveals the issue instantly through:
- Red variance indicators  
- Forecast vs. Actual deviation visuals  
- Region + product contribution analysis  

The data shows the decline is **surgical**, not systemic.

## ✅ Step 2 — Forecast Modeling (Python)

The analytics team runs multiple time-series models:
- **ARIMA**
- **Prophet**
- **Exponential Smoothing**

### 📊 Model Output
- Product Line B projected to decline another **8–12% next quarter** if nothing changes.  
- Product Line A stable with **+5% expected growth**.  
- Pricing elasticity model shows **high sensitivity** — the recent **7% price increase** heavily impacts demand.

Forecasting confirms the decline is **predictable**, not random.

## ✅ Step 3 — Root Cause Insights

A cross-functional drill-down reveals three overlooked issues:

### 🔍 Root Causes  
1. **Marketing spend in the West dropped 40%** due to budget delays.  
2. A major competitor launched a similar product at **6% lower price**.  
3. Inventory coverage fell below **2 weeks of supply** during seasonal demand spikes.  

Each department was partially right — the data connects all three.

## ✅ Step 4 — Executive Recommendations

The dashboard produces data-backed actions:

- **Rollback the 7% price increase** or offer promotions  
  - Expected **+6% revenue rebound**  
- **Restore marketing spend** in Region West  
  - Expected **+4–7% lift**  
- **Increase inventory buffer** before seasonal spikes  
  - Expected **+3% revenue protection**  

These recommendations appear directly in the CEO dashboard as scenario simulations.

## ✅ Step 5 — Outcome

After leadership implements the changes:

- The sales decline **reverses within 2 reporting cycles**  
- Forecast accuracy rises back to **91%**  
- Product Line B stabilizes with **+3% QoQ recovery**  
- Executive team adopts the dashboard as a weekly alignment tool  

The investigation proves the value of **integrated retail analytics** across forecasting, pricing, marketing, and inventory functions.
